__Collaborate · Innovate · Automate__

MIShell.org is a collaborative initiative developed by a dedicated team of IT professionals from multiple ISDs and schools throughout Michigan. Our collective aim is to provide a comprehensive repository of scripts specifically tailored for the needs of K-12 system administrators.

__Our Vision__
As technology becomes increasingly integral to educational environments, our vision is to empower system administrators with the tools and resources necessary to enhance efficiency, promote best practices, and maintain robust security across K-12 institutions statewide.
